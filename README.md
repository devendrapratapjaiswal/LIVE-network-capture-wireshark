# Task 5 â€“ Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

This repository contains the complete work for **Task 5** of my Cybersecurity Internship at **ElevateLabs**.  
The goal of this task was to capture live network traffic using **Wireshark**, analyze the protocols, and understand packet-level communication.

---

## Objective

- Capture live traffic on my local machine.
- Analyze and identify various protocol types (at least 3).
- Export the packet capture as a `.pcapng` file.
- Document the findings and packet details through screenshots and report.
